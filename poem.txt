Lines of Code

In the quiet of the terminal's glow,
Where logic flows and functions grow,
A poem forms from bits and bytes,
In the language that the machine knows.

Variables dance in memory's space,
Loops and conditions find their place,
Each semicolon, each curly brace,
Tells a story, sets the pace.

From hello world to complex dreams,
Code becomes more than it seems,
A bridge between the mind and screen,
Where human thought and machine meet.

So here's a verse in plain text form,
A simple file to keep you warm,
A poem born from keyboard keys,
In the repository, if you please.
